    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
            Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
            developers.</li>
        <li>Relative links link to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
            page</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Relative links are nice because they let you move around entire folders
                    without having to update all the href’s on your <a> elements, but they can
                        get a little confusing when all your links start with a bunch of dots.
                        They’re best for referring to resources in the same folder or in a standalone
                        section of your website.</li>
            </ul>
        <!-- <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, -->
                <!-- but those aren't useful to us right now.</li> -->
        <li>Absolute links, like
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
               target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
               resource for web developers.</li>
            
    </ul>
