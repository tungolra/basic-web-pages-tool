    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
       <!-- Sometimes you do want to prevent the margins from collapsing.
        All you need to do is put another invisible element in between them -->
    <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div> 
    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>
<!-- there are many times when we need a generic box purely for the sake of styling 
    a web page. This is what <div> and <span> are for. -->
    <div class="button">Button</div>
